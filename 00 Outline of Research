This project will involve:
1) Deployment of Orca in CU research
2) Creating SoP and workflow both for completing research using Orca and orienting future students.
3) Literature search to find infrared, Raman, and Microwave data for a list of substrate molecules.
4) Validating Orca results against previous computational results and experimental results
5) Determing accuracy and precision for computational results vs experimental
6) Determing offsets for specific method's that have systematic errors.
7) Predict infrared and Raman spectra for a list of target substrate molecules.
8) Calculate conformation energies and molecular structures using several basis sets and methods for target substrate molecules.
9) Fit Structural Parameters to experimental constants (microwave constants prefered) for target substrate molecules.
10) Tabulating and Presenting these results.
