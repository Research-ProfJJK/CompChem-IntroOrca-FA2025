Please note that this page is essentially a more sharable and teamwork friendly version of a lab notebook. This Git repository is where you will commit your work and notes to so they may be shared and documented.

This project will involve:
1) Deployment of Orca in CU research
2) Creating SoP and workflow both for completing research using Orca and orienting future students.
3) Literature search to find infrared, Raman, and Microwave data for a list of substrate molecules.
4) Validating Orca results against previous computational results and experimental results
5) Determing accuracy and precision for computational results vs experimental
6) Determing offsets for specific method's that have systematic errors.
7) Predict infrared and Raman spectra for a list of target substrate molecules.
8) Obtain spectra of substrates that we do not already have.
9) Calculate conformation energies and molecular structures using several basis sets and methods for target substrate molecules.
10) Fit Structural Parameters to experimental constants (microwave constants prefered) for target substrate molecules.
11) Tabulating and Presenting these results.
