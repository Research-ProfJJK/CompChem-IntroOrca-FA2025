This project will involve:
1) Deployment of Orca in CU research
2) Creating SoP and workflow both for completing research using Orca but orienting future students.
3) Validating Orca results against previous computational results and experimental results
4) Determing accuracy and precision for computational results vs experimental
5) Determing offsets for specific method's that have systematic errors.
