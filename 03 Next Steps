Once you have gotten a handle on Orca, the GUI, and Git you will need to branch this main directory to create your own sub-repo. This branch is where you will commit your calculations, bibliography, and articles. It is likely desireable to further branch your own sub repo where necessary so as to keep your work organized.
Please label your main branch in the format:
Date-Substrate1-Substrate2-Initials
Example: 
2025FA-Glycerol-Pyruvate-JJK
My sub branches/directories would look like:
2025FA-Glycerol
2025FA-Pyruvate

Within the 2025FA-Glycerol-Pyruvate-JJK branch I would likely have several files like:
2025-08 Notes
2025-09 Notes
GUI Notes
Proposed SoP 1
Proposed SoP 2 (branch of 1)

Which I generate as I work through my research and record issues.

Any files that cannot be committed to the GitHub (here) I should request Dr. Klaassen to make a Google folder that is shared with me so I can upload the files there then paste a link to the file along with a description at the most logical place in the Github repo.

Please note that it is entirely acceptable to use a tablet or physical notebook. 
If using a tablet upload the note files to the github repo as mentioned above. Make sure it is a common format like .doc, .pdf, .jpg, etc. and not an app propriotary file.
If using pen and paper then you can using CamScanner to record the notes in nice, easy to read, pdfs. These can then be uploaded to the repo (if they end up to big let me know and I will create a Google Drive like mentioned above).
